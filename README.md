JavaScript app to make API calls to Spotify

This application allows users to display a mini spotify music player through the web. I helped build out this project because spotify had removed the ability
to full screen its application. I found this feature very useful as I have a small 4inch monitor deticated to spotify. With this application I was able to deticate this 
monitor to music control.
